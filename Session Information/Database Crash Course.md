## Before the Workshop

To prepare to follow along the presentation please download and install the following resoures:

* [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
* [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

On Windows, there is an install wizard you can use. Make sure you download both MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench, and optionally any "connectors" you may need for the programming language(s) you will be using. If prompted during installation, select the standalone server option and make sure you enable TCP/IP connections on port 3306 (this is the default port).
