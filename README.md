* üíõ Equity  
    Tackle inequities in gender, education, health, and more.  
    You might build an application that makes computer education more accessible to minorities, connects people with their nearest COVID testing sites, or even tackles homelessness in your city.    
     
* ‚úèÔ∏è Efficiency  
    Hack to improve some process and improve our productivity.  
    Do you wish there were an automated process to fill out job applications? Are you unsatisfied with your current note-taking app? Find a pain point and build a solution!
  
* üå≥ Environment
    Set us on a better path towards sustainability.  
    Build a mobile app that sends daily environmental facts or a calculator that compares the environmental impact of various items at the grocery store.  Get creative with how you can help us reduce our environmental impact!
